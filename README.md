# Robot Line Follower – State Machine

This project implements a line-following robot using a finite state machine.
The controller separates sensing and driving behaviors into distinct states,
allowing smoother and more reliable line tracking.

## Key Features
- Finite State Machine (FSM) control architecture
- Clear separation of sensing and motion states
- Improved stability compared to purely reactive control

## Code
- `lab2Robot.py` – main robot control program
